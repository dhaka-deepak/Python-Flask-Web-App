# Python-Flask-Web-App

The purpose of this web application is to provide a user-friendly interface for generating contextually relevant responses to user inputs. The application integrates with the ChatGPT API, which is a pre-trained artificial intelligence model capable of generating natural language responses to user prompts.

The application consists of two main pages, a homepage and a results page. The homepage features a simple form where users can input a question or prompt. Once the user submits the form, the application makes an API call to the ChatGPT API and receives a response based on the user's input and context. The application then displays the generated response on the results page.

The web application is built using Python and the Flask framework, which provides the necessary tools for creating and deploying web applications. We also use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend design to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

Overall, the purpose of this Flask web application is to simplify the process of generating contextually relevant responses to user inputs using the power of artificial intelligence.
